			Spike is a lovable lazy boy with a single braincell.  
			He loves catnip more than anything else and has done some questionable things to get it. </p> 
			<p class="clearr"> <img class= "right" src="../images/sofia.jpg" alt="picture of a black cat">Sofia: Spike’s littermate.  Sofia is the neighborhood watch cat, 
			keeping the squirrels under surveillance from her favorite window seat. 
			She is the most vocal and opinionated of the cats. </p>
			<p class="clearr"><img class= "left" src="../images/bea.jpg" alt="picture of a gray cat">Bea: she was a lonely and beat up kitten we found abandoned at my in-law’s farm back in 2017. 
			Now she runs our house with her charm, stealing hearts…and any small object she can carry off and hid under the rug.</p> 
			<p class="clearr"> <img class= "right" src="../images/lila.jpg" alt="picture of a tuxedo cat" >Lila: the newest addition to our family.  
			Lila showed up on our porch in November and wouldn’t leave.  
			I brought her inside on the eve of a winter storm.  
			Only a few months later, she is a little princess who only knows comfort.</p>
