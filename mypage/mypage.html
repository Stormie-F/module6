			<p>Hi, I’m Stormie (she/they)! </p>
			<p> I can write about anything except myself. </p>
			<p>So here goes nothing.</p> <p> I have 10 years of experience working in libraries and archives. I am currently a full-time MLIS student at IU.  
			I will graduate in June 2025 following a study-abroad trip in Finland.  
			When I’m not studying I enjoy reading, playing video games, listening to Critical Role, playing table top games, painting minis, and spending time with my husband and our cats. </p>

        <aside>
            <h2>Streaming</h2> <p> I stream some of my gaming and art adventures on twitch.tv. 
			On there I am known as Kreti_Wife. <br> </p><img src="images/meet.jpg" alt="Meet the streamer.  I play cozy games, paint D&D Minis, and talk about life.  Thank you for joining me!">
			 <p> My current stream schedule is Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday @ 10 am EST. </p>
